```

For running tests with Playwright UI:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### 1. Design Choices: React & Tailwind CSS
- **React**: Utilizes React for declarative components and local state management, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Uses utility-first classes for rapid styling, leading to cleaner components and reduced custom CSS.

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Tailwind CSS**: Generates only necessary styles, reducing the final CSS bundle size.
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Functional components and hooks like `useCallback` minimize re-renders for better responsiveness.

### 3. Scalability Considerations
- **Component Reusability**: Components like `Story`, `StoryViewer`, and `StoryPreviewer` are reusable, making scaling easy.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive with Tailwind, ensuring seamless adaptation to all screen sizes.

### 4. Testing
End-to-End Tests: Playwright tests the full user journey, simulating user interactions with the app. This ensures that the app behaves as expected in a real-world scenario.
